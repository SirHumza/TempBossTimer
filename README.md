# TempBossTimer

TempBossTimer is a simple and visually appealing web-based timer that tracks a 15-minute cycle for boss spawns. When the timer reaches zero, a 'BOSS SPAWNED!' message appears for 2 minutes before resetting to another 15-minute waiting period.
This is made for the skynlock gamemode of the server asianf4rmer.minecraft.pe (a server I normally play on my free time)
